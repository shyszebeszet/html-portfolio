        <h2>
            Jurassic Park
        </h2>
        <p>
            The best kiddy-horror movie there is.
            No sci-fi has ever come close to its magesty. <br> Has enjoyable sequels but the bar that had been set was
            never met.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Children of men</h2>
        <p>Another one of a kind sci-fi made by a visionary director who knew what he was doing.
            One of a kind in terms of its approach. <br> Gripping and thrilling.
            <br>
            Made with the same care as Jurassic Park but its for adults without the dinosaurs and with more thrills and
            chills.

    <li>
        <h2>Lion King</h2>
        <p>The Disney Movie. <em>Enuff said. </em> </p>
